Abstract

A set of algorithms were designed, implemented and evaluated in order to identify clusters of conserved waters
in binding pockets i.e. hydration sites, and quantify, by calculating their enthalpy and entropy, their contribution 
to the free energy of binding in a ligand-protein association. The information obtained by using these algorithms could 
contribute to the development of new drugs by generating new ligands that target specific high-energy unfavorable waters.
Evaluation tests show that our algorithms can indeed provide relevant data about how hydration sites influence ligand-protein
binding.
